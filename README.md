## About the course
This course is for developers who would like to know how to use CWP SilverStripe to build websites for both government and private sector organisations.

Students will leave the course with an understanding of what the Common Web Platform (CWP) version of SilverStripe is, what its out of the box features are, and practical, hands-on knowledge of how to use it to build websites.

After an introduction, students will be hands-on gaining practical knowledge and experience in many aspects of SilverStripe development by creating a small website they can take away at the end of the day.

### Note

Currently CWP SilverStripe version 3.x is taught on this course, but this will upgrade to SilverStripe 4.x once the CWP version of SilverStripe 4 is ready.
