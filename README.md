# Introduction

This repository is for the SilverStripe developer course run at Catalyst, which has been updated to reflect changes for SilverStripe 4 and CWP 2. It contains the lessons students work though on the course.

Currently this is a 1-day intro course, but a second day covering more advanced topics is planned if there is sufficient interest.

The training is scheduled at various times throughout the year. If you are interested in attending or would like to find out more, please see..

## About the course
This course is for developers who would like to know how to use SilverStripe to build websites for both government and private sector organisations.

Students will leave the course with an understanding of what SilverStripe is, what its out of the box features are, and practical, hands-on knowledge of how to use the CWP recipe to build websites.

While this course does use CWP as a basis for training, its focus is to give users a general knowledge of how to build a website using open-source SilverStripe modules. You will learn how to create your own modules, write your own extensions, and develop a theme on top of a recipe.

After an introduction, students will be hands-on gaining practical knowledge and experience in many aspects of SilverStripe development by creating a small website they can take away at the end of the day.

## Course outline

We will cover the following topics...
* How to install SilverStripe
* An explanation of site structure and how things work
* Theme layout, development, and configuration
* Creating new page types
* The ORM, and how to abstract your database queries
* adding new fields to page types in the CMS
* how to develop a module
* ModelAdmins and GridFields
* how to write a DataExtension
* How to write a form from scratch

### Notes

These are the topics normally covered but might alter slightly depending on time, and the needs of the trainees.

Almost everything that is taught about SilverStripe development on this course can be used on every installation of SilverStripe: it is not specifically a CWP development course. The CWP project is installed to demonstrate an example of common modules encounted on SilverStripe websites throughout New Zealand.


## Target Audience

The course is aimed at PHP developers wanting an introduction to SilverStripe development.

## Prerequisites
Students should have some experience with PHP, HTML, and CSS. Experience with Git, Composer, and the command line would also be helpful.
