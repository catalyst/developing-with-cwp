### What is SilverStripe?
SilverStripe is a free and open source content management system and framework for creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It provides an out of the box web-based administration panel that enables users to make modifications to parts of the website, which includes a WYSIWYG website editor.

The framework is modular, flexible, and extensible. It provides a seamless method of working with database records without needing to write complicated database queries.

The word SilverStripe means a lot of things:
